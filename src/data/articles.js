While deal volumes increased 19% year-on-year in Q4 2023, the average time to complete corporate finance transactions has simultaneously increased to an estimated 13 months.

IT firms demonstrate particular confidence, with 83% expressing optimism about 2024. This sectoral variation reflects differences in how buyers construct their investment theses across industries.

I had that data going back years in a financial model so that I could compare year-on-year behaviour by programme, by income source, by marketing source.

The translation cost in a live process is time, credibility and valuation. EBITDA add-backs are presented by founders as straightforward normalisation. Buyers are discounting unsubstantiated add-backs by 30 to 50 per cent, meaning a founder who cannot evidence each adjustment with a paper trail is effectively gifting valuation points to the buyer.",
